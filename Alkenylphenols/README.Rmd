Maynard_etal_AlkenylphenolFungalBioassays.csv
These data were collected from microdilution assays in September 2018

Maynard_etal_PiperRemovalStudy.csv
These data were collected from observing 10 individual plants of Piper sancti-felicis
during May 26 to May 31 2009.

Maynard_etal_AlkenylphenolAnimalTrials.csv
These data were collecting January-March 2018. We conducted feeding trials in a 
controlled flight cage setting with one representative species from each group of 
dispersers: Seba’s Short-tailed Bat (Carollia perspicillata) and 
Passerini’s Tanager (Ramphocelus passerinii.
