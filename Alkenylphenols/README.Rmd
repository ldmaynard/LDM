These data were collected from microdilution assays in September 2018

ID = individual identifier
well = well of the 96-well plate
fungi = species of fungi (R3, R23, R26)
Conc = concentration of alkenylphenols in the well (starting concentration = x and halved 8 times)
day 0 = average absorbance (OD) after 0 h
day 1 = average absorbance (OD) after 24 h

Maynard_etal_PiperRemovalStudy.csv
These data were collected from observing 10 individual plants of Piper sancti-felicis
during May 26 to May 31 2009.

event = individual identifier of the event
tree.no = individual identifier of the tree
branch.no = individual identifier of the branch

Maynard_etal_AlkenylphenolAnimalTrials.csv
These data were collecting January-March 2018. We conducted feeding trials in a 
controlled flight cage setting with one representative species from each group of 
dispersers: Seba’s Short-tailed Bat (Carollia perspicillata) and 
Passerini’s Tanager (Ramphocelus passerinii.
